My name is Matthew and I am here on Git Hub to help develope coding skills with hopes of potentially finding a job. I enjoy reading about economics, philosophy, and technology. Love science fiction books, favorites being Neuromancer Dune, Battlefielf Earth, and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Im hoping to actualize some of these ideas by becoming more practically involed in technology, Git Hub is my first step in that direction. Thanks Git Hub for providing the platform!
